# FlowDemo

This is a demo of using GenStage/Flow to improve the speed of parsing a largish
data set. I start with a regular Enum-centric solution, then move to a Stream
implementation, and finally to Flow.

I'm doing each implementation on a different branch.

## Todos

1. Add benchmarking
1. Add a large dataset to show the differences in each implementation
1. Visualizations?
